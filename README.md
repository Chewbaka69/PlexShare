# PlexShare
Web Application standalone that provide the management of local users, many server and the libraries.

## V2 started
Why starting a V2, while V1 is not Finish?
Because the technology use is no more what i want for this app.

So the V2 will use NextJS and Laravel
New design for the FrontEnd and new Code for the Backend :)

### Little issue
Issue with NextJS 15...
Trying to fix it

# Description
With this web application, anyone can create an account directly this app.
Every body can add his PlexServer to the list.
When you are connected by default you have access to all servers.
But the admin can manage permission by user or by library like limit of number streaming, the quality and other

With only one interface and without plex.tv registration, everybody can have access to the libraries of all the servers you have registered.
